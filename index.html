                Welcome to this fan-page of PCMasterRace. If you are a console peasant, please go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage" class="ignore-css" style="height:4px;font: size 4px;">here</a> instead.
                We all know PCs have reached their golden age, where they are accessible to most people, but before cloud gaming services and Moore's law
                will ruin it all. r/PCMasterRace, set up by u/pedro19, is one of the largest subreddits and online communities, full with people following
                their love for PCs and all the goodness they bring. There are also variations of the online sub-culture, like r/linuxmasterrace,
                r/ultrawidemasterrace and others.

                The term "PCMasterRace" was first shown to the world by comedic writer Ben Croshaw in 2008. Although intially meant as a poke of fun towards
                the elitist attiude of the Witcher Community, it quickly spread, as do all internet quotes, to become an well-known expression of pride
                of what PCs have become. While it is technacilly a reference to Nazi-Germany's idea of a "master race", most users of the term do not 
                associate with that at all. This can be argued to be positive, as the previous use of the reference is no longer publicly used.
