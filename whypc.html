               Especially if you are a console peasant, you may scuff at this subculture, without understanding its foundation. But it does have one,
               as there are many reasons why PCs are the superior physical platform to use.

            <h2 class="maintext">Freedom of use</h2>
            <p class="maintext">
                One of the most logical advantages of PCs is that when you buy them, they are yours to use, tweak,<del>and destroy</del>.
                Even if you don't build your PC yourself and get it from an OEM as a pre-built, it is yours to keep. This freedom of use 
                can be taken even further, if you use Linux instead of Windows. Sure, Windows works, but Linux gives you the ultimate
                freedom, at the cost of most times simplicity, which is why Linux is daunting at a first look. If you want to try it,
                check out r/linux or any linux distro subreddit. A PC, unlike a console, can be customized to your liking. If you want
                screaming RGB LEDS everywhere, you can. If you want to add an NVME SSD for faster boot times, you can. This is part of what
                makes the early 21st century the golden age for PCs, as we have reached the middle ground between no and full modularity.

                It can't be ignored; PCs are fully modular. Especially if you build it yourself, you have full choice on what you want to
                use for parts, and there is a huge market full of decicated companies with tons of products to choose from. These are some 
                of the companies situated in the western market:

                What can you use a console for? Gaming, mabye watching a movie. What can you use a modern smartphone for?
                A lot, but not high-processing-power demanding tasks, like video-editing. Sure, putting a filer on a video
                is also video-editing, we mean <b>serious</b> video-editing. A PC? It can do whatever you want it do. You
                can decide to spend a lot more on a CPU and RAM and be able to do serious progamming, or get a great GPU and
                play any modern title at more than just the 60FPS consoles and mobile phones struggle to reach, with great 
                graphical features, like Adaptive Sync, Ray Tracing in every variant, and much more.

                If you need to have 50TB of storage for your audiovisual products, you can just buy a NAS, and connect it to
                your PC. And if you have a tight budget, a $500 PC can do wonders, seriously. For gamers it is even more wonderful.
                You're no longer stuck with a bland store full of $60 exclusives, but with multiple websites like Steam and GOG,
                which include thousands of <b>free-to-play</b> games. And most of these aren't freemium either. And then look at
                modding communities. Do you know of any well-established PS4 game with mods? Probably not, and I don't know any
                either. PC games, on the other hand, commonly have mod support, and with at least unlocked directories, most games
                can even work on third-party software, created by the community. A great example is Terraria's modding community, which
                nowadays mostly runs with TModLoader, a reliable, actually good looking software, with an not even very daunting
                installation process. I'm not the first to state that modding can keep game communities alive, why else would we be
                playing G-Mod, Minecraft or GTA V after so many years?
